# DictionaryMaker

This program takes a txt as an input and then gives it back as a csv file with the most common words inside the text and its related translation so it can be used in a flashcard app like Anki.

I'm using this project as a way to improve my programming skills and learn more things.

I started as a console application that works more like a script than a program (current state)

I started using API (google translate) in this app

I'll try to implement another API so I can generate phrases from individual words

I'll convert everthing as ASP.NET project, using MVC (I don't know how to do it yet)

I'll implement database using Entity Framework
